# Jamming
Jamming is a capstone project I completed during the Codecademy Full-Stick Engineer career path.

I leveraged basic React skills to create an app that connects to the Spotify API and allows users to search for songs, add them to a playlist, and save playlist to their Spotify account.

In this project I learned how to navigate the complexities of API authentication, the basics of creating a React app, and how to publish it to production using Surge.

In addition to the basic requirements of the project, I added additional functionality including the removal of a song from the search results once a user adds it to their playlist.  As part of this feature, I created a formal feature request documenting the requested feature.
