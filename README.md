# Jamming :musical_score: :musical_keyboard:
Jamming is a capstone project I completed during the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer career path.

I leveraged React skills to create an app that connects to the Spotify API and allows users to:
- Search for songs 
- Add songs to a playlist
- Save the new playlist to their Spotify account.

In this project I learned how to navigate the complexities of API authentication, the basics of creating a React app, and how to publish it to production using Surge.

In addition to the basic requirements of the project, I added additional functionality to remove a song from the search results once added to a playlist.  This will prevent users from duplicating songs on their playlist.
